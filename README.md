## Card Class Exercise

In the src folder, create a file called Card.java that defines a playing card class. This class should have:

* at least two instance variables that store suit and value for each card object
* one default constructor that takes no parameters and creates a Joker card
* one two parameter constructor that takes in suit and value and stores them in instance variables
* a toString method that allows the user to print a String describing the card (ie- "2 of Hearts")
* in the App method
  * create and print two Joker cards
  * create and print 13 cards for each suit with proper values and suits
